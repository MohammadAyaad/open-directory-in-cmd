# Open Directory in CMD
a useful edit for windows users to add an option to the context menu "Open in CMD" to open a command prompt in the same directory as executed on "Open in CMD"
you can click at any empty space and then "Open in CMD" and it'll just work

jut download the `open dir in cmd setup.reg` and run it and you can delete it after you are done and congrats!
