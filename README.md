# Open Directory in CMD
a useful edit for windows users to add an option to the context menu "Open in CMD" to open a command prompt in the same directory as executed on "Open in CMD"
you can click on a selected directory or at any empty space and it'll still work

jut download the `open in cmd setup.reg` and run it and you can delete it after you are done and congrats!
